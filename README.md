大家好! 👋

I built this app to help with learning the vocabulary for CHI 108. It's a full-featured Chinese learning tool with flashcards, handwriting practice, games, and more!

## ⚡️ Quick Start (TL;DR)
1. Visit the app **[https://lillianwang112.github.io/chinese-learning-app/](https://lillianwang112.github.io/chinese-learning-app/)**
2. Download JSON files from the [108vocab folder](https://github.com/lillianwang112/chinese-learning-app/tree/main/108vocab)
3. Import them into the app → Click "Import Deck"
4. Start with **Study Mode** for flashcard learning
5. Use **Learn Mode** for active quizzing
6. Use **Writing** to practice handwriting characters

## 📱 What Can This App Do?

- **Flashcard Mode**: Smart spaced repetition (cards you struggle with come back sooner!)
- **Learn Mode**: Quiz yourself actively with multiple choice, fill-in-blank, or written answer questions
- **Writing Practice**: Handwrite/draw characters with your mouse/stylus/finger, with a **Test Mode** that hides characters
- **Match Game**: Fun timed matching exercise with a live timer and personal best tracking
- **Test Mode**: Quiz yourself with multiple choice
- **Progress Tracking**: See your stats with 3-tier mastery system (Not Started → Still Learning → Mastered)
- **Combine Decks**: Merge multiple decks for weekly review sessions

The app uses the **SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm** - the same one used by Quizlet, Anki and other popular flashcard apps!

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Open the App
Visit: **[https://lillianwang112.github.io/chinese-learning-app/](https://lillianwang112.github.io/chinese-learning-app/)**

### Step 2: Download Vocabulary Files
All the CHI108 vocabulary JSON files are in the [108vocab folder](https://github.com/lillianwang112/chinese-learning-app/tree/main/108vocab) of this GitHub repository. The CHI103 mega vocabulary files are in the [103vocab folder](https://github.com/lillianwang112/chinese-learning-app/tree/main/103vocab).

**To download**:
1. Go to the vocabulary folder
2. Click on a JSON file you want (e.g., `高考.json`)
3. Click the **"Download"** button (or right-click "Raw" → "Save link as...")
4. Save it to your computer

**Pro tip**: Download all the files you need at once! Right-click each → "Save link as..."

### Step 3: Import into the App
1. In the app, click **"Import Deck"**
2. Select the JSON file you downloaded
3. The vocabulary will be added to your deck!
4. Repeat for any other topics you want to study

### Step 4: Start Learning! 🎉
- Click **"Study"** to review with flashcards
- Click **"Practice Writing"** to draw characters
- Use **"Match Game"** or **"Test"** for quick reviews

## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Import multiple decks** - Add all the topics we're covering this semester
2. **Use writing practice** - Actually drawing characters helps with retention way more than just recognition
3. **Try different modes** - Mix up flashcards, writing, matching, and tests to keep it interesting
4. **Combine decks before quizzes** - Use the Combine Decks feature to merge multiple lessons into one deck for weekly review
5. **Use Writing Test Mode** - Once you're somewhat comfortable with the characters, switch to Test Mode where the characters are hidden and you write from memory

## 📚 Available Vocabulary Decks

We have **24 vocabulary decks** covering all CHI 108 topics — that's **over 900 vocabulary words** total! 🎉

All CHI 108 vocabulary files are in the [108vocab folder](https://github.com/lillianwang112/chinese-learning-app/tree/main/108vocab). The CHI 103 character list is in the [103vocab folder](https://github.com/lillianwang112/chinese-learning-app/tree/main/103vocab).

**Note:** Decks contain ALL vocabulary from the 课本, not just study guide items. You can edit decks to remove extras if needed.

## ✨ App Features

### 📖 Study Mode (Flashcards)
- Click the card to flip between Chinese character and detailed English definitions
- Audio pronunciation button lets you hear the word
- Shows pinyin with tone marks and comprehensive word meanings
- After flipping, choose:
  - **"I Know This" (swipe right/green button)** - Card moves further back in review queue
  - **"Still Learning" (swipe left/red button)** - Card comes back sooner for more practice
- Cards you mark "Still Learning" are re-inserted proportionally into the deck (e.g., ~5-6 cards later in a 30-card deck) so you see them again without it feeling too soon
- Smart spaced repetition tracks which cards need more practice

### ✍️ Writing Practice
- **Four modes**:
  - **Practice 10**: Practice 10 random cards at a time
  - **Practice All**: Practice every card in the deck
  - **Test 10**: 10 random cards with characters **hidden** — only pinyin and English shown. Write from memory!
  - **Test All**: Test yourself on every card with characters hidden
- Draw characters with your mouse/stylus/finger on the canvas
- Scroll back up when you're done drawing to see if you got it right
- Rate yourself honestly:
  - **"I Know This"** - You wrote it correctly → Card moves to the back of the queue
  - **"I Forgot"** - You got it wrong or needed to peek → Card comes back sooner for more practice
- **Test Mode exclusive**: Press the **"Reveal"** button to show the hidden character and check your answer
- Clear button to erase and try again
- Audio pronunciation button available
- Keep practicing! Cards you struggle with will reappear until you master them
- **Pro tip**: In regular practice modes, scroll slightly down to cover up the character(s) to exercise your memory

  <em>Left: Character visible | Middle: Scroll to hide character | Right: Compare your answer</em>
</p>

### 🧠 Learn Mode (Active Quizzing)
- **Two question types** that alternate:
  - **Multiple Choice**: See the Chinese character, select correct English meaning from 4 options
  - **Fill in the Blank**: See the character, type the pinyin pronunciation
- **Quizlet-style progression**: Cards you get wrong are re-queued within the same round so you see them again before moving on — just like Quizlet Plus Learn mode
- **Tip for typing pinyin**: You can type with tone numbers (ni3 ha3o) OR with tone marks (nǐ hǎo) - both work!
- Instant feedback shows if you're correct or need more practice
- Shows correct answer with pinyin and meaning after each question
- Progress bar tracks your completion (e.g., "2 of 15")
- Mastery status badge shows each card's current level: 🆕 Not Started, 📖 Still Learning, or ✅ Mastered

### 🎮 Match Game
- 16 tiles appear: 8 Chinese characters + 8 English meanings
- Click two tiles to match them
- Correct matches stay revealed and fade out
- **Live timer** counts up in real time (to the tenth of a second) as you play
- **Personal best tracking**: Your best time for each deck is saved and displayed on the results screen
- Beat your record and get a 🏆 **New Best Time!** celebration
- Great for quick vocabulary refreshers!

### 📝 Test Mode
- Multiple choice questions
- Immediate feedback
- Track your score

### 📊 3-Tier Mastery System
Cards are tracked across all study modes with a Quizlet-style progression:
- **🆕 Not Started** (gray) — Cards you haven't studied yet
- **📖 Still Learning** (orange) — You've seen the card but haven't consistently gotten it right
- **✅ Mastered** (green) — You've demonstrated solid knowledge across multiple interactions

The mastery score builds up gradually: strong correct answers give +2, okay answers give +1, and wrong answers give -1. Getting one question wrong won't immediately drop a mastered card — it takes consistent mistakes to lose mastery. Progress bars on the home screen and stats page show all three tiers.

### 🔀 Combine Decks
- **Merge multiple decks** into one combined deck for weekly review or exam prep
- Go to **Create Deck** → scroll down to **Combine Decks**
- Select 2 or more decks to merge
- Duplicate characters are automatically removed
- Combined decks start with fresh mastery scores for a clean review experience
- Original decks remain untouched
- **Example use case**: Combine 高考 + 开放留学政策 + 家里的小皇帝 into a "Week 7-8 Review" deck before a quiz

### 📋 Deck Management
- **Edit deck name**: Click Edit → change the deck title at the top
- **Add/delete cards**: Edit individual cards within a deck
- **Export/Import**: Back up your decks as JSON files
- **Delete decks**: Remove decks you no longer need

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 🚀 Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work on my phone?</strong></summary>
<br>
Absolutely! Just open it in your mobile browser. Although it may be better to use on a tablet with a stylus for the handwriting practice. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this offline?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Once the page loads, you can study without internet.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I study multiple topics at once?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Import as many vocabulary decks as you want at a time.
</details>

### 📚 Deck Management

<details>
<summary><strong>What are the buttons at the bottom of each deck?</strong></summary>
<br>
Blue pencil = Edit deck, Green = Export/Download, Red = Delete entire deck
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I delete cards I already know?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Click the edit (pencil) button on a deck, then delete individual cards you don't need.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I rename a deck?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Click Edit on the deck and change the name at the top of the edit page.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I combine decks for weekly review?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Go to Create Deck → Combine Decks. Select the decks you want to merge and give the combined deck a name. Great for quiz prep!
</details>

### 📖 Study Features

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the mastery system work?</strong></summary>
<br>
Cards progress through three stages: Not Started → Still Learning → Mastered. Your mastery score builds up with correct answers and goes down with wrong ones, but it's gradual — one mistake won't reset your progress.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the spaced repetition work?</strong></summary>
<br>
Cards you mark "I Know This" come back less frequently. Cards you mark "Still Learning" or get wrong in quizzes come back sooner for more practice. The spacing is proportional to your deck size so it feels natural.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to enter tone marks when typing pinyin?</strong></summary>
<br>
The app accepts both! Type "ni3 ha3o" or "nǐ hǎo" - it checks both.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between Writing Practice and Writing Test Mode?</strong></summary>
<br>
In Practice mode, you can see the Chinese characters above while you draw. In Test mode, the characters are hidden — you only see pinyin and English, so you have to write from memory. You can press "Reveal" to check your answer.
</details>

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>My progress disappeared!?</strong></summary>
<br>
Your progress is saved in your browser's local storage. If you clear browser data or switch browsers, you'll lose progress. Use the Export button (green) to back up your deck (especially if you added/deleted words)!
</details>
