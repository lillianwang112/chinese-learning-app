# Chinese Learning App - CHI 108

大家好! 👋

I built this app to help with learning the vocabulary for CHI 108. It's a full-featured Chinese learning tool with flashcards, handwriting practice, games, and more! 

## ⚡️ Quick Start (TL;DR)
1. Visit the app → Click "Import Deck"
2. Download JSON files from the [108vocab folder](https://github.com/lillianwang112/chinese-learning-app/tree/main/108vocab)
3. Import them into the app
4. Start with **Study Mode** to learn new words
5. Use **Learn Mode** to test yourself
6. Use **Writing** to practice handwriting characters

## 📱 What Can This App Do?

- **Flashcard Mode**: Smart spaced repetition (cards you struggle with come back sooner!)
- **Learn Mode**: Quiz yourself actively with multiple choice, fill-in-blank, or written answer questions
- **Writing Practice**: Draw characters with your mouse/stylus/finger
- **Match Game**: Fun timed matching exercise
- **Test Mode**: Quiz yourself with multiple choice
- **Progress Tracking**: See your stats and which cards need review

The app uses the **SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm** - the same one used by Quizlet, Anki and other popular flashcard apps!

## ❓ Questions?

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: Yes! Once the page loads, you can study without internet.

**Q: Does this work on my phone?**
A: Absolutely! Just open it in your mobile browser. Although it may be better to use on a tablet with 
a stylus for the handwriting practice. Rotating your phone horizontally and handwriting with your finger
also works.

A: Yes! Import as many vocabulary decks as you want at a time.

**Q: What are the buttons at the bottom of each deck?**
A: Blue pencil = Edit deck, Green = Export/Download, Red = Delete entire deck

**Q: Do I need to enter tone marks when typing pinyin?**
A: The app accepts both! Type "ni3 ha3o" or "nǐ hǎo" - it checks both.

**Q: Can I delete cards I already know?**
A: Yes! Click the edit (pencil) button on a deck, then delete individual cards you don't need.

**Q: How does the spaced repetition work?**
A: Cards you mark "I Know This" come back less frequently. Cards you mark "Still Learning" or get wrong in quizzes come back sooner for more practice.
