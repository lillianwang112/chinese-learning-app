# Chinese Learning App - CHI 108

大家好! 👋

I built this app to help with learning the vocabulary for CHI 108. It's a full-featured Chinese learning tool with flashcards, handwriting practice, games, and more! 

## 📱 What Can This App Do?

- **Flashcard Mode**: Smart spaced repetition (cards you struggle with come back sooner!)
- **Learn Mode**: Quiz yourself actively with multiple choice, fill-in-blank, or written answer questions
- **Writing Practice**: Draw characters with your mouse/finger and get instant feedback
- **Match Game**: Fun timed matching exercise
- **Test Mode**: Quiz yourself with multiple choice
- **Progress Tracking**: See your stats and which cards need review

The app uses the **SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm** - the same one used by Quizlet, Anki and other popular flashcard apps!
